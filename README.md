# Forkify
For all the pizza lovers (including me!) out there, this is a web application that finds all sorts of specialty pizza recipes using the Food2Fork API, and allows users to save them, view recipes, and adjust recipes based on portion size.
Built using JS/HTML/CSS, Babel, Webpack, Node, Axios. 
It was my first time using these new packages and NPM, so it was quite a struggle but in the end 'twas worth it! :)
Completed this course project as a part of a JavaScript development course on Udemy.
